# Troubleshooting

## In-game

### Naked NPCs

Uninstalling or updating armor and clothing mods may cause NPCs may cause them to become naked.

You can attempt to fix this by resetting the inventory of a naked NPC.
To do so, open the console, click on the NPC and run the `resetinventory` command.
This is not a guaranteed fix.
